**Q: What is Dark Mode?**
A: Dark Mode is a new system-level visual theme that applies a darker color scheme to the application interface. It is designed to improve visual comfort and accessibility, particularly in low-light environments or for users sensitive to bright screens.

**Q: How do I enable Dark Mode?**
A: You can enable Dark Mode by navigating to 'Interface Settings' within the application. There, you will find a dedicated toggle to activate or deactivate Dark Mode.

**Q: Does Dark Mode respect my operating system's preference?**
A: Yes, the system will initially check and apply your operating system's Dark Mode preference. However, the toggle available in 'Interface Settings' allows you to override this system preference, giving you full control over the application's theme regardless of your OS settings.

**Q: Is Dark Mode the same as High Contrast mode?**
A: No, Dark Mode is distinct from the 'High Contrast' mode. While both aim to improve readability, Dark Mode primarily changes the overall color palette to a darker theme, whereas High Contrast mode specifically adjusts color combinations to maximize the visual difference between foreground and background elements for users with specific visual impairments.

**Q: What happened to the previous theme-picker feature?**
A: The previous theme-picker feature has been deprecated and replaced by the new Dark Mode implementation. Dark Mode offers a more integrated and system-level approach to theme management.

### Security Update: Enhanced Site Navigation Security (HTTPS)

### Overview
This entry details a recent security enhancement where all site navigation links have been updated to utilize the HTTPS protocol. This change significantly improves the security and privacy of your interactions with our website by encrypting data transmitted between your browser and our servers. No user action is required as a result of this update.

### What is this change?
We have successfully deployed an update (Ticket ID: WEB-305) that transitions all internal site navigation links to use the HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol. Previously, some navigation elements might have used HTTP. This update ensures a consistent and secure browsing experience across the entire platform.

### Why was this change made?
The primary reason for this update is to enhance the overall security of our website. HTTPS encrypts the communication between your web browser and our server, protecting your data from potential eavesdropping or tampering by malicious third parties. This ensures greater privacy and integrity for your browsing sessions, especially when navigating through different sections of the site.

### What do I need to do?
No user action is required. This update was implemented on the server side and automatically applies to all users. You will continue to access and navigate the site as usual, now with the added benefit of enhanced security.
